C++ Booleans
C++ Booleans
Very often, in programming, you will need a data type that can only have one of two values, like:

YES / NO
ON / OFF
TRUE / FALSE
For this, C++ has a bool data type, which can take the values true (1) or false (0).

Boolean Values
A boolean variable is declared with the bool keyword and can take the values true or false:

Example
bool isCodingFun = true;
bool isFishTasty = false;
cout << isCodingFun;  // Outputs 1 (true)
cout << isFishTasty;  // Outputs 0 (false)
From the example above, you can read that a true value returns 1, and false returns 0.

However, it is more common to return a boolean value by comparing values and variables (see next page).

C++ Boolean Expressions
Boolean Expression
A Boolean expression returns a boolean value, which is either 1 (true) or 0 (false).

This is useful for building logic and finding answers.

You can use a comparison operator, such as the greater than (>) operator, to find out if an expression (or variable) is true or false:

Example
int x = 10;
int y = 9;
cout << (x > y); // returns 1 (true), because 10 is higher than 9
Or even easier:

Example
cout << (10 > 9); // returns 1 (true), because 10 is higher than 9
In the examples below, we use the equal to (==) operator to evaluate an expression:

Example
int x = 10;
cout << (x == 10);  // returns 1 (true), because the value of x is equal to 10
Example
cout << (10 == 15);  // returns 0 (false), because 10 is not equal to 15

C++ Boolean Examples
Real Life Example
Let's think of a "real life example" where we need to find out if a person is old enough to vote.

In the example below, we use the >= comparison operator to find out if the age (25) is greater than OR equal to the voting age limit, which is set to 18:

Example
int myAge = 25;
int votingAge = 18;

cout << (myAge >= votingAge); // returns 1 (true), meaning 25 year olds are allowed to vote!
Cool, right? An even better approach (since we are on a roll now), would be to wrap the code above in an if...else statement, so we can perform different actions depending on the result:

Example
Output "Old enough to vote!" if myAge is greater than or equal to 18. Otherwise output "Not old enough to vote.":

int myAge = 25;
int votingAge = 18;

if (myAge >= votingAge) {
  cout << "Old enough to vote!";
} else {
  cout << "Not old enough to vote.";
}

// Outputs: Old enough to vote!
Booleans are the basis for all C++ comparisons and conditions.

You will learn more about conditions (if...else) in the next chapter.
